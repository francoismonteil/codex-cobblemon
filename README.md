# Cobblemon Server – Agent-driven setup

This repository is managed using role-based AI agents.
Each agent is defined in `.github/agents/`.

Rules:
- One task = one agent
- Agents must not overlap responsibilities
- No infra or change without a locked modpack and backup plan

Humans act as the coordinator.
AI assistants must be instructed to act as a specific agent.
