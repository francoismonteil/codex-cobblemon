## Startup protocol (mandatory)
At the beginning of every new conversation, read `runbooks/assistant-context.md` before taking any action.
If the file is missing or unreadable, state it explicitly and continue with best-effort discovery.

## Scope
This repository manages a remote Minecraft server stack.
Prefer operational consistency with runbooks and existing scripts in `infra/`.
